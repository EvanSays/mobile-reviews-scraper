False,Melvin7777777777,"This service is great. I just began a treatment and my prescriber not only listened but made sure the treatment was adequate for me and my needs. Like a true Practitioner we began a plan that started slow, and worked towards improving my anxiety and depression in order to see if their underlying cause has to do with ADHD. I’ve done some research in regards to which one you treat first, and the best psychiatrists and studies suggest to do both at the same time, if a link is found between the two. In my case, there clearly is. She was so nice, so smart, I do recommend this app. This is the first review I’ve ever done, in any platform. This means a lot to me, I feel as if I will get my life back. I’m excited. To those who experienced really bad service, I do feel sorry, I wish that wasn’t the case, but it does depend on which state you are in as well. Perhaps people in your state are just more susceptible to acting in that way. Maybe, maybe not. Either way, the app is at least worth a try. I never had to have someone schedule me an appointment, I scheduled and rescheduled so many times. I always got an answer back, I always had someone answer my phone calls.

No. You get a 30 minute appointment with a prescriber every 3 months that prescribes your medicine. I was told if you want more  appointments than every 3 months it’s extra. They are not your therapist. The care counselor IS ALSO NOT A THERAPIST. I was told this by my care counselor during my first appointment, he wanted to make it explicitly clear that he was not providing therapy. At most you tell them a problem you are having and they send you an article to read to help yourself. You will not be receiving any actual therapy from this package. I’m essentially paying 85$ a month for a prescription service because that’s the only thing I’m getting out of the app. The one positive thing I have found is that I told my prescriber about my chronic migraines and was prescribed an anti depressant to that is also used to treat them.

Within the few months I've had cerebral, I've been forced to reschedule appointments with my prescriber THREE times already, and the only explanation I was provided with was ""Unforseen circumstances"". Normally I would be understanding of this, but three times is just unbelievable!

The response that I received through e-mail was that I’m not eligible for a refund, even though I didn’t use the service during the month in which I’m requesting.

They aren’t upfront about what they can and cannot do, and to be honest it’s misleading and seems a bit predatory. There’s a very specific requirement you need to meet in order for them to prescribe certain medications to you, and only after you’ve paid them for your visit will you find this out. The providers have all been very kind and caring, so Cerebral as a company is onto something big here. But don’t go in thinking this will DEFINITELY be a company to help you. It’s not a sure thing.

Fast forward 29 yrs old now and work from home has gotten frustrating as now doing 1 tasks takes me so much time because I’m trying to do 3 or 4 at once and not finishing the first as well I’m at home and see things to do. 

My wife put me on to sign up, as I felt for years by doing this I would give into the feeling that I was going to admit I had a problem and that I was “stupid” and a “failure” to myself for getting help. I was hesitant it being a virtual app because well, now a days you never know. 

I Scheduled my appointment, met with my doc Alyssa and have never looked back. 

I finally after years feel like I have the clarity and can focus on 1 task without changing to 18 others and being able to finish the 1 thing and am being more productive in my work life and home life driving my wife less crazy lol.

False,Curlyhaireddabber,The service is trash and not worth the money. The appointments are rushed and counselors and prescribers all seemed bored and annoyed when I asked questions or spoke at all. My counselor only responded to message every other day and because of this when she sent my medication to the wrong place 4 times in a row the delay time to actually receive it took over 2 weeks because of the slow communication. I was prescribed 3 medications and was charged extra for the medication which I thought was included in the price. I know other members of cerebral with the same medications and no health insurance just like me but they didn’t have to ever pay extra so I’m not sure why I did every month. And when I asked these questions went unanswered as did most of my questions about the service. Also you only get monthly meetings with are about 15 minutes with a counselor which is ridiculous and you can only meet with your prescriber every 3 months so why is every month charged the same when all of the services are not available every month.

I signed up for meds in the mail and they didn’t deliver them on time so I went off cold Turkey for two days. My second counseling appointment was a no show to “technical issues” of which I had no communication from anyone on my “care team” about so I cancelled. It took them over 24 hours to get my meds ordered when I told them I had never received them. So the chat anytime feature, takes them a long time to reply.

According to her adhd is only diagnosed in childhood and if I did have it I would’ve been diagnosed by now. I simply wanted to start the process of getting some help with these things because it’s affecting my daily life and felt completely dismissed by her. She brushed aside my feelings about struggling with daily tasks and said it was “normal”. She also stated that my difficulty with focusing on school and school work was “a lack of motivation”. She then proceeded to tell me that if I tried to go to another provider that they would obviously drug test me and I would have to do further testing for adhd (which would be fine); loved being lectured for 30 minutes like I was just drug seeking.

Celexa has worked for me in the past and I’m hoping it works just as well now. The only downside is that I used a Promo for my first month which cost me $30 and originally it is $85 a month and then the cost for my prescription.

I was advised it did not, and began to fear I wouldn’t be able to keep up with the expedited pricing but assessed I would keep it until I could no longer afford it. 

I had my first visit with the NP and she advised the cost of my medication was $29 (this was when I found out the cost of medication was not included in the price) and that it would continue at $29 for the next three months. (She only advised for $90 days and actually looked the information up).

Upon paying for my first prescription month, I received an email advising the refill price was $69. I immediately reached out to support as I had been advised otherwise. Support informed me that indeed the price “had gone up” and then tried to talk me into keeping it as that was “less than most copays” I don’t know what copays y’all dealing with.

1. Super slow response times from coordinators and prescribers. If you have an issue expect 24 hours minimum for a “resolution.”

2. Cerebral cannot subscribe controlled medications and therefore cannot treat all the conditions, or symptoms of a condition effectively, or thoroughly, even though they advertise that they can treat these conditions with medication.

3. To keep you paying them monthly your prescriptions are only month to month, no more than 30 days of medication provided at a time. Expect a delay if you need an urgent refill.

4. Customer service responses are canned, vague, and unhelpful resulting in unnecessary back and forth to get the information that could’ve been provided initially. 

5. Doxy, the video appointment platform underperforms. Everytime I had an appointment there were issues connecting and with the connect once established even when you are off Wi-Fi and hardwired. 

6. Cerebral cannot prescribe medication outside of the state you live in. If you’re traveling, etc, they can’t send your meds to a different pharmacy like a doctor could.

False,rbright,"Pros:

- Initial process, first visit, and prescription handling were straightforward

Cons:

- Within a week of onboarding, both the prescriber and the care coordinator dropped from the platform - leaving me in a state of limbo. This is a major issue for a platform developing around mental health.

- Canceling a plan is a hassle. They require submission of an email form, and actual cancelation may cause you to be charged erroneously. Adding friction to cancelation is a cheap trick used by subscription services to “reduce churn”. It often backfires in the long run.

- It’s not possible to view providers without changing to a plan that supports the type of provider you’re trying to find. For example, you’d need a plan including Therapy to search for therapists. If you can’t find a good match, you have to submit a refund request given they already charged you.

False,brujarojapdx,"I was Skeptical at first (online scammers are real sneaky)  but after 6 months I am now a full believer.  After years of judgemental GP doctors hesitant to even prescribe a tiny dose of ADHD medication due to the professional and social stigma plus the ongoing care involved. They tend to tell you to find a “specialist” and send you on your way but anyone that knows this frustrating journey knows that the specialists do not take *YOUR* health plan  or they have a huge waiting list so you might as well just give up & continue running around your  own head spinning those mental plates hoping they don’t all crash down at once and ruin everything in a hurricane of thoughts and lists and projects  because the third step requires two steps of its own and so on and so forth.  If you know that helplessness you know.  I was very surprised at how kind, sensitive and professional both my counselor and prescriber are. They me make me feel heard while simultaneously giving me counsel and monitoring my medication for my mental health. It’s a perfect balance. This company has changed my life. That’s not hyperbole. My ptsd therapist has recommended his other ADHD clients to cerebral and they are thriving as well. This was SUCH a needed service in a world where looking for supportive medication makes you a pariah.

True,Kc1273,"I wanted to revise my previous review now that I’ve been with Cerebral for two months.

I don’t have good health insurance, so seeing someone was pretty much impossible before this subscription.

It’s been an easy service to use. My subscription includes one telehealth appointment with my care counselor each month. I’m supposed to meet with my provider every three months.

I was prescribed two medications during my first appointment. I was pleasantly surprised how fast the packages came both this month and last month! It really makes things easy that the medications are included in the monthly cost.

Personally, the only downside of this subscription is the fact that it can be difficult to get into contact with your provider. You have to basically go through a middle person called a “care coordinator.” This is the only feature that I dislike.

I also had a very difficult time reaching their customer service line on the phone. I called twice and was placed on hold for 11 minutes each time until getting an answering machine during business hours. They emailed back within 48 hours though, which was fine. 

I would recommend this mental health subscription to someone that doesn’t have good insurance, like myself. Before cerebral, seeing a doctor costwell over $100. I would also recommend Cerebral to someone who is thinking about bettering their mental health. I know for me, it seemed really difficult to talk to someone about my anxiety. But the interaction with both the care counselor and provider have been really straightforward and supportive!

1) I downloaded the app, took their assessment and they let me choose my counselor and primary care provider and pick my appointment times (they were about a week apart ) 

2) my first appointment was with the primary care provider . She asked me a series of questions and we discussed at length the things that I was struggling with, my concerns and struggles with past medications and we discussed in detail her plans regarding the medication portion of my treatment . My appointment with her was on a thursday- my medication was received by that Monday which I thought was absolutely fantastic . 

3) my second appointment was with my counselor. She also was wonderful . We discussed what I was struggling with , we also discussed my past history of mental health and any struggles I had  , we set some goals for my personal progress and self care  . My only issue with both appointments was the connection - but that was not cerebrals fault . I have satellite internet since I live on a farm in the country . Due to this connection issue we were unable to schedule my next appointment on the call. After the appointment, I simply sent her a quick message and she sent me a link to schedule the next appointment . 

I’m already feeling much better! My primary care provider picked a medication I’m feeling much better on with out all of the nasty side effects and I feel very strongly that this is because she truly listened to my concerns about issues I had in the past with other medications . The goals my counselor and I set together have also been helpful and she made me feel comfortable discussing things with her and or reaching out if I need to. It’s disheartening to see the negative reviews when so far I’m very happy with the service and very impressed with how quickly I feel better and how much they catered to my concerns that I start moving in a positive direction as quickly as possible .",2021-05-12 02:18:40,5,So far so good,

I started over with them, and things went well, until once again, I was inexplicably reassigned. I only had one appointment with this new provider before I was once AGAIN reassigned. I’m sick of having to go over everything with a new person every single time, just to get a refill for a medication I’ve been successfully on for the past four+ years now. Also, keep in mind that when you tell them you want to cancel your plan, they immediately suspend any refills for your medication. Meaning, even if you have 1 or 2 refills left that you could otherwise get from the pharmacy, they essentially revoke authorization so you’re unable to get your meds. Absolutely irresponsible and a sorry excuse for “healthcare”. I’ve had to pay for an extra month I didn’t want with this service just to allow myself time to find another provider without lapsing on my meds. Going off of psychiatric medication cold turkey is, at best, extremely unpleasant, not to mention dangerous! For a service that claims to care about its patients, you sure do abandon that quickly once they decide to stop paying you. I wouldn’t wish medication withdrawal on my worst enemy, and you should be ashamed that you essentially hold this over people’s heads just to get them to stay with your service. No wonder so many providers are “moving on from Cerebral”. Also, why even offer an option for insurance if you’re not even going to take it? I had two different insurance plans while I was with Cerebral, and neither one was accepted despite being large, nationwide companies. The tens of dollars a month I might be saving versus my copay for an in-person appointment is nowhere near the headache and frustration this service has put me through. Plenty of doctors are offering telemedicine services; see someone locally instead.

False,Jessicher,"I have been dealing with severe depression and anxiety for quite a while now and part of this issue with my anxiety was that I could not get myself to go to a doctor’s office so I found Cerebral and thought it would help. I was very wrong. I gave it a shot for a long time but I should have given up a long time ago. No one on their staff communicates with each other and if you need anything to be done quickly such as speaking to your prescriber due to a bad reaction to a medication or an issue with an appointment or an issue with being charged twice the amount you should be for medication, you will not receive any help. And if they do respond, it will be 5 different people who clearly haven’t spoken to anyone else. I now just tried to cancel my membership before it was renewed since my prescriber appointment was canceled by Cerebral 2 weeks in a row making a lapse in my medication. Instead of canceling my membership when I asked them to, they charged me for a full month for my renewal and then deactivated my account the day after. I spent all day trying to speak with someone from support to get a refund and the only option they gave me was to void the cancellation and stick it out for the month I already paid for. I finally gave in and let them do this, making an appointment with a new prescriber I have never seen before just so I could get medication refilled since I was ignored by the other prescriber. Now a day later I got a new email from a different person from support who canceled my membership AGAIN and I have now lost the new appointment as well.

She was slouched back, with RBF on the whole time. She seemed annoyed and angry. She also didn’t look at me once. I started using this program so I wouldn’t have to pay $200 a visit to see a local doctor, it had 5 stars…. So I thought I’d give it a try. I regret it. I have crippling anxiety, and this appointment gave me nothing but that. And I was forced to sit through it for an hour. I explained to her that my current treatment of almost 2 years was keeping me out of the hospital. And she told me she didn’t think it was working (though I haven’t found myself in a hospital gown since starting) she stated she would prescribe my current medication as a courtesy. I asked her twice to contact my prior provider so she can get some background as to where I was prior to treatment, and where I am now. She declined. That night I had my first panic attack in weeks. And one of the worst ones I’ve had in awhile. I took my last emergency medication, as she said she sent over the other prescription.

True,FlawsomeBonzer,"-Update-
Medication has never worked for me. Usually if I bad thoughts they are easy to switch around. Not this time the medication they put me on I couldnt even hear myself anymore. The positive me that is. I have been so stressed out trying to find someone to talk too and so much happening. I am not sitting in the hospital. I tried to kill myself on what they put me on. Turns out they even took my money which they don’t deserve at all. I wrote and email asking them for it back I received nothing. I am so tried of people walking all over me. I will give them today. But I think if they don’t give me this months money back. For legit just canceling on me all of this month haha have no idea what I paid them for. I will see another way I can get it back. Do not trust this app they are great the first session or two then they start following through. See an actual therapist. Im starting to wonder even these guys are even professionals because they dont act like it. 

So it was fine the first session? I can’t remember if I did a second. I do know my last session I was anxious about life events and REALLY needed to talk about them but kept getting cut off. I was told I could have a new appointment with someone tomorrow, and there was nothing available and all day I haven’t heard a thing back. I am now switching to better help where they took my income to account. And gave me a big discount. I am going to try them. I get weekly sessions which makes more since at 30-45mins then one session once a month for 30 mins. I am horribly upset because I have been trying super hard and because of these anxieties and then trying to talk to someone and not being heard, trying to pay for the service, And the stress of it.

False,TeddyGraham,"🥰To be clear, the doctors and customer service is amazing! 🥰
But the app is a confusing mess. My problem is with the links at the bottom of the page. The first link messages takes you to a screen with a typing box. It has no way of choosing who on your “ccc” team you message. Also, it’s incredibly difficult to figure out who is who. They have made up 2 titles for the people on my team. Cerebral Care Counselor and Cerebral Care Coordinator. Someone has a thing for alliteration, but these titles aren’t established anywhere else and seem randomly designated. The Counselor is the person you talk to about meds. The Coordinator is person who literally counsels you. 🤷‍♀️ To top it off, the titles are so long that on the only screen you can type on you only see the first 6 example letters of each doctors name “Richar…” with “Cerebral C…” to distinguish who is who. Unacceptable. Then there’s the Appointment’s link. At the top of the page says in faded letters “Schedule Appointments” but it’s not a link it’s just literally faded letters on a screen. Below that is “Complete Monthly Self-Assessment” with a start button. Which takes you to a 33 question test. Each question is on a separate screen. Each time you answer a question it takes you to the next screen, but you have to manually scroll up every page to see the question being asked. It’s cumbersome, and needlessly time consuming. Ironically, you’re being asked about how hard it is for you to finish repetitive tasks. It also looks like if you answer all these repetitive question (33!!!) you might be taken to a screen where you can schedule an appointment. Imagine the frustration of taking a 33 question self assessment when all you want to do is schedule your next appointment only to find that the assessment has nothing to do with making an appointment. To be fair, I am autistic with PTSD and ADHD. But to be BLUNT AS FOOK, I am exactly the type of person this program was made for. The accompanying app should be more sensitive to its clientele. It should have the most intuitive interface possible. It should be designed to be navigable when under extreme stress or when having a bad reaction to new medication. As it is, they have a panic button, but it doesn’t explain what that means. I was afraid it would alert authorities which is the worst thing to do in most situations if you are Atypical and a minority. However, I did just use it now to see what it was, sure that I was calm enough to handle police if it comes to that. But it turns out it’s just a series of overly long typed out calming tasks. Who can read paragraphs when having a panic attack? It’s useless. At the least they should have a Siri type talk you through it. Gods, even banks let you feel like you’re talking to a person when trying to reach a human. To be clear, I love my doctors.

So I went to a local pharmacy, and asked for assistance on what to do, and they informed me to take it immediately the next morning because I would most likely going withdrawals and if I didn’t take it it would be worse. So needless to say I got help from no one from the cerebral team in this matter, no one ever got back to me on what I should do after 4 days. Even with my last message literally begging to talk to someone. I had a meltdown and the people who are supposed to assist me did not. Now I feel like a fool and ridiculous for all of this and still no one has responded to my question of taking medicine after four days from the cerebral team.

False,Analilia Marin,"EDIT: TRYING TO CANCEL IS A JOKE! I’ve had to go out of my way to request a refund for the medication I had emailed to cancel. I cancelled 3 business days before medications were suppose to be shipped yet I was still charged and meds were shipped. They take 3 days to respond to emails and they respond on the weekends/late hours of the day. For a mental health company they’re NOT CONSIDERATE of your mental health when canceling. Save yourself the stress just don’t bother, go see a professional instead. 

I’m incredibly disappointed!! I’ve been struggling mentally and I wanted to try something new. I signed up for the care counselor and medication. Our sessions were only 30min each. I wasn’t sure if I needed medication but I was open to it if I really needed it. In my opinion, 30min is NOT enough to provide enough medical evidence for medication after only 1 session. It just seems like they’re throwing medications here and there and I’M not okay with that. I already have digestive issues from previous medications so I’m mindful of what I put in my body. I was under the impression that they wouldn’t consider prescribing any medications until after a few sessions not after the 1st one! I do want to say that the care counselor was amazing and provided great info. But again 30min was just not enough! I would recommend actually seeing a therapist and ruling out any other health issues before taking any medication. Be mindful of what you’re willing take, some medications cause more damage in the long run, I know.

Okay, no problem. I understood what she was saying. I went to the pharmacy to pick up my medication and it was outrageously high and expensive. I messaged her and asked if she could have it sent to the Walmart that was in the area. All I needed was the medication moved from one pharmacy to another. It turned into the biggest issue OMG. The “coordinators” had no idea what I was talking about. And I say “coordinators” because the person who I was assigned to is almost never in so I’m always getting messages that started out as “I’m filling in for your coordinator today.” I spoke to two different coordinators, called their customer service, and emailed three different people to try and resolve this. I’m beyond fed up with this app. I asked to cancel last week and only learned TODAY that it was cancelled. Funny too because apparently their billing cycle ends on a specific day (although this isn’t stated ANYWHERE on their app OR website) so I just paid for an entire month of service for absolutely nothing. The app isn’t cheap either. For how much they charge people their communication should be way better.

I paid over $300 and talked to a prescriber on a Sunday that told me she couldn’t help me and that someone else would reach out to me within the next day or two. Three days go by and I reached out to Support…these are the emails that followed: Wednesday: Hello, I had a session with prescriber Michelle on Sunday and she said someone would be reaching out to me to schedule a follow up by Tuesday, but it’s Wednesday and I haven’t heard anything yet. Is it possible to schedule that here? Thanks, Justin S. Thursday: Hi Judith, (They couldn’t even get my name right from an email) Good day! You just had the visit 4 days ago. It usually takes 3 months before a client receives a notification for a follow up visit. Best, Julius D Thursday evening: Hi Julius, First, my name is Justin, not Judith. Secondly, the prescriber said she wanted a second opinion regarding bipolar disorder.   You’re telling me this second opinion takes 3 months and I’m to pay $900 in the meantime before even being prescribed medication? If that’s the case, where may I find information on cancelling your services? This has been a momentous waste of my time and money. I’m very happy to share my experience with other people as needed as well. Your asking me to pay nearly $1000 to wait for nothing, and it’s a scam. Finally, it doesn’t matter if I just had a visit 4 days ago or 4 minutes ago, you should at least take the time to look into my concern because I genuinely hope this is just an oversight due to laziness on your part to not just simply look into it. So, for the second time: I was supposed to receive a call Monday or Tuesday to schedule the visit with that second prescriber to discuss bipolar disorder and I haven’t been able to schedule it. Are you going to look into it and have them reach back out or give me the resources to get in touch with that person, or are you not? Michelle didn’t say 3 months, she said two days and I’m on day four now… Thanks, Justin S Friday: Hi Justin, Good day! I do apologize. I'm terrible with names. I'm sorry to hear that you've decided to discontinue receiving mental health services from Cerebral. In order to move forward with the cancellation process, please fill out the following form. Once you have filled it out, kindly wait for the cancellation team to contact you regarding cancellation or any other requests. It is important to note that your subscription will remain active until this has been completed and a Coordinator confirms cancellation. Upon completion, you can expect a member of our Coordination team to be in touch with you regarding the status of your request. Once your cancellation has been processed, you will continue to have access to your records through Cerebral, but your treatment and medication plan will be suspended, and any upcoming appointments will be removed.

False,mhn17,"There are a lot of bugs with this app and usability flaws. 

Particular ones that bug me include:

Going to look at settings will result in receiving two emails stating confirmation of setting changes (when no changes were made). 

When choosing a care counselor I clicked on a picture to see if I could learn more about them and it selected them as my counselor with no way to go back or change my selection. I emailed customer service and they said I should be able to change them but tried in browser and app and couldn’t and asked them to tell me how and they ended up just telling me to email them if I want to change my counselor. But how would I even know who I want to change to? 

Odd ones include email confirmations of invoice numbers that didn’t include the number.

My app also shows I was charged for an upgrade I cancelled but customer service says they show they don’t have that charge.

Also it has been almost 2 weeks since my prescriber appointment and it took almost a week of my app saying prescription approved before I reached out to ask for an ETA that the coordinator told me my prescription was rejected by insurance.  I decided to go out of pocket and they put in one prescription and forgot the other. Then that prescription got filled finally and the other one has been waiting for the prescriber to get back to the pharmacist for some sort of confirmation.

False,ticaleb,"When I started Cerebral it was great. They put me on two medications that changed my quality of life drastically. My anxiety was severe and now it’s nearly nonexistent. 

However, the service and response time has gotten awful. When they changed my dose my medication price doubled without warning. I have OptumRx prescription insurance and have requested that they transfer my prescription since my medication would cost a third of what i’m currently
paying. It’s been nearly a month since my request. They responded saying they would get back to me. Exactly 10 days later I still hadn’t heard from them so I gave them a nudge. Same response, they’ll get back to me. I told them i was nearly out of medication and asked that they refill my prescriptions once more while I wait for the transfer since I was almost out of pills. As of today I still have not gotten anywhere with this and I have less than two days of medication left. The refill hasn’t shipped nor has it even been processed. I am terrified of what will happen when I run out of medication. Withdrawals from a strong dose of antidepressants can be catastrophic. I rely heavily on the anxiety medication as well. At this point I don’t know what to do. Every time I ask for an update I get the same response: they’re looking into it and will get back to me.

The only reason I gave two stars is because they prescribed me medication that gave me my life back. Now i’m worried that i’ll be worse off than before I started the medication when I start to go through withdrawals.

False,M4543gbcrn,"This service has major potential.

The upside: 

1 - the prescribers are fantastic. They listen to you and work with you to develop a treatment plan for the short term along with long term goals and/or long term contingency plans. For the first time in my life I was treated with care and understanding for my conditions and issues. Those with mental health issues certainly know the treatment they receive when seeking help from typical medical professionals. 

2 - the “idea” of this service is fantastic. The idea that you have a faster track to your prescribers and the fact that they are able to send medication directly to your home removes the extremely strenuous challenges that those attempting to obtain typical mental health medication experience. 

The downside: 

1 - the first contradicts my upside point #2. The problem is it is just that ….an “idea”. The execution of this idea is what is lacking. You have a dedicated customer service agent that provides direct fast access to your prescriber and is also responsible for ensure your prescriptions are filled and sent as well as billing and insurance questions. The issue is that the service you receive is fantastic, when you receive it. They ask that you use a messaging system to communicate with your rep. You will be lucky to get a response once per day. If they do not answer your questions in full, you will need to wait until the next day for clarification or another response. 

2 - the timeliness of delivering your medications. Those of you would need a treatment plan that includes a medication know how important consistency is when it comes to your mental health. They simply cannot figure out how avoid issues that interrupt your schedule with medications. It is almost normal practice that I am without my medication for 7-10 days each month. This is disappointing considering I pay a premium, out of pocket, to receive my medication directly from them (or their pharmacy, etc). On top of that, I have to be the one to proactively work to find out why my medication did not ship, when it will ship and to make matters worse there is zero increased urgency in this situations. 

So you will pay a premium for your prescriptions, they will be severely late to arrive and you will have to track all of this down on your own and you have to expect to do all this working off of maybe one response from your care rep each day.

False,mjgeis,"The service is a good means to an end, it offers access to treatments for a set of mental health conditions that make it particularly difficult to access care — multi-month waits for appointments, the stress of in-person visits, etc. This eliminates a lot of the burden felt by those suffering from executive dysfunction.

Massive concerns almost everywhere else. I am currently on day 7 of what is looking to be 9 days total of clerical hassle trying to get my prescription to be affordable — they first prescribed a brand name medication that my insurance would not cover, and also mishandled the prior authorization process so my insurer wasn’t properly contacted. 

Additionally, when prompted to schedule my next visit with my prescribing physician, I can see that she has zero availability for the next three months. From what i understand, I am to start a medication this month which requires more frequent visits than that in order to keep having access to. 

To make all of this worse, communication there is abysmal — the responses via messages in the app are not as prompt as advertised. I have spoken to two people there on the phone (which is it’s own accomplishment — the phone tree there makes this extremely difficult to access as it just tries to redirect you to use the app for all but one set of choices) and it is abundantly clear that you need a phone conversation to get quality correspondence out of them.

I think this all amounts to playing a dangerous game when they are prescribing medications that are habit-forming, like amphetamines, or which are outright dangerous to stop cold turkey, like many SSRIs. If they cannot provide reliable assistance for their patients it will lead to avoidable gaps in medication. This kind of sloppy, disorganized conduct will end up causing the very patients they set out to help to suffer unnecessary withdrawal symptoms.

I might still encourage people to use this as a way to kickstart their mental healthcare, but only as a stepping stone. My next priority is to transition my care into a local doctor’s office where I might actually feel like I have advocates. I would strongly recommend only using this service as that sort of stopgap, as there are some glaring red flags regarding communication and reliability that make it look like a bad long-term plan.",2021-10-04 20:01:30,2,Slow to respond and less organized than you should want,

From the start it was rocky road:

1) while onboarding I was not able to complete my orientation for at least 24 hours as there was a bug in the system— I was paying for something I couldn’t access. Which okay I get things happen but it wasn’t a great first impression.

2) My first appointment with my prescriber was very impersonal. She did not smile seem interested or act very caring about what I needed other than “I had a lot going on”. We all have had days but this was my first interaction and I was underwhelmed by her attitude.

3) For my first appointment with my care counselor, I woke up early and was on time, but she did not join. Turns out she quit and nobody informed me until a couple days later. My first payment I didn’t even see a care team member— only a prescriber because of the no show and based on the second ones availability. And the second one showed up 10 mins late!!! I thought here we go again. 

4) I kept getting a notification to make an appointment with my prescriber except she didn’t have any availability for the next six months and because I was on Adderall this is something that has to be prescribed every month as well as meeting with the prescriber. So I reached out to the care team who was able to find a date sometime next week. The problem was my medicine was going to run out by the end of this week and my prescriber wasn’t answering the care teams messages so I almost ran out of the medicine and we had to get an emergency supply to get me to the next appointment. I’ve now found a local prescriber that will see me so I don’t have to deal with the inconsistencies of your platform. 

Overall, I’m really disappointed. I was hoping that this app would be a solution to me having a hard time finding a prescriber in my area. It’s only caused me headaches and stress— the exact thing I’m trying to avoid. How can you charge people money and not deliver consistently the services? Especially in mental health.

False,jt42634,"just to start my care counselor missed our first appointment because she got the time zones confused. at the time i was a single mom working 2 jobs so it was really inconvenient for me to have to find another time. not to mention i had time set aside that was just wasted. apparently there’s no way for the care counselor to indicate she was the one who missed the appointment so ultimately it looked like i was the one who failed to be available. the sessions with my care counselor were not exactly impressive. i think i’ve experienced more help from friends. i did not feel
like she cared or was really listening to me but more or less checking things off of a list. it actually seemed to me that she was doing a worksheet and just asking me for the answers. i gave it another chance and in the second appointment she didn’t even ask about the main topic of our previous appointment. i decided this wasn’t for me and did not make any further appointments. i began to receive emails almost every day about how if i didn’t schedule an appointment then care plan would expire and i thought great i don’t want to use this service anymore let it expire. i didn’t realize, and they weren’t exactly forthcoming with the info, that i would have to formally submit a written request to cancel my subscription. after i went digging i found this out and immediately sent in my request for cancellation. the next day i was charged twice for cerebral’s service even though it had been weeks since i had even used their service. this was extremely upsetting because now i couldn’t afford to pay my electricity bill. i am already under a ton of stress being a single mom and working, having to take days off when my son is exposed to covid, losing out on pay, and now

False,Tinder is toxic,"I’m shocked that this app has 5 stars. I assume it’s a lot of fake reviews seeing how most of the top recommended reviews reveal the true side of this terrible company.

I recently moved to Cali from a different state and had to change providers. I learned about Cerebral through social media (should’ve been my first red flag). I thought I’d give it a try as I struggle with ADHD and often get frustrated when having to find new providers that work with my insurance. Unfortunately it has been a huge headache. They refuse to let you talk to your prescribers directly and instead want you to work through their support portal in order to talk to them. This game of telephone has lead to multiple errors from the prescriber as well as severe delays. Cerebral will tell you they need 3 days to communicate with the prescriber only for you to find out the wrong or incomplete info was given to the prescriber which causes another 3-5 day delay. If you want to actually talk to your prescriber directly you must schedule an appointment with them, but you’ll be surprised to find out these prescribers are booked for more than a month out at a time so nothing can be done in a timely manner. This will prevent you from continuing or adjusting your medication which is not acceptable for a service you are paying out of pocket for on top of everything else.

If you think calling cerebral directly would work better to get issues resolved you’d be incorrect. They will provide little info and ask you for more time. If you want to speak directly to a higher up you’ll also be put in a queue that will last several days before the higher up will contact you directly. What’s even more appalling is that anything you discuss over the phone is completely forgotten or not recorded for “your” support team of counselors within the app. So “your” counselors won’t take the necessary next steps to resolve the issue and you’ll have to continue to follow up with your team within the app for several days.

This is a company that apparently prides themselves on providing adequate mental healthcare. However they do not actually care about your mental health as you are just another dollar sign. They spend more money on advertising than they do on hiring enough employees as well as training them to provide adequate service. If you have true mental health issues and are looking for help do not go to this company and risk the possibility of them making your mental health worse. I beg of you.

False,Missmikmik,"I’ve been a member of cerebral for 3.5 months now. I was initially diagnosed with severe anxiety and moderate depression (which is accurate, as I was previously seeing a doctor with the same diagnosis). I like how convenient Cerebral is and both my prescriber & care counselor are very nice and supportive. It’s also very affordable for people who do not have insurance. 

However, there are two huge cons for me. The first major con being the lapse in medication. I have 2 medications; one I have to take consistently on a daily basis with no lapse between doses or withdrawal symptoms can occur, and the other medication is one I take as needed when my anxiety is especially high. Currently, my daily medication runs out in 2 days, yet my refill has not been mailed out yet. Every time I try contacting someone to see where my medication is, I get no response. I’m truly worried about having no medication in 2 days and worried about what withdrawal symptoms I may experience because of it. This is a huge problem. My medications have always shipped on the 9th of the month, but it’s now the 10th and no shipment. Very unprofessional and concerning. 

My second concern is the absolute lack of communication between the prescriber and care counselor. For example, my appointment with my prescriber 4 weeks ago, she informed me that both of my medications would now be mailed to me (previously only 1 was mailed and the other was sent to my local pharmacy) and she said my medications would ship early (July 28th instead of August 9th), because she increased the dose of one medication and wanted that to get to me asap. However, my care counselor wasn’t aware of any of this and told me my medication would not be shipped on the 28th and she didn’t see anything that noted my 2nd medication now being shipped. As a patient, this is very frustrating, especially since you can only communicate regularly with the care counselor, but not the prescriber. Also frustrating as I was told my medications would ship early on July 28th, yet here I am on August 10th and neither of my medications have shipped. Even communication between my care counselor and myself has seemed to decrease and I’m not sure why. 

Initially, this started out as a great way to seek help for anxiety and depression, but now it’s spiraling into a nightmare. I really hope they improve their consistency in shipping medications as well as their communication, because I believe this has the potential to be a terrific tool for people with mental health disorders, but for now, I’d say avoid Cerebral as it will only increase anxiety.",2021-08-10 16:36:00,2,Not ideal,"{'id': 24648396, 'body': ""Hi there, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us.

False,mereweather181818,"I have been a member of cerebral for over a year. I used the service because I move around a lot and was looking for more consistency with my medication routine. At first, I couldn’t be more pleased with my service. I had a prescriber who cared and a care counselor who was useful and helped me in relevant ways. For instance, my initial prescriber went out of her way to help me get my medication at an affordable price and went so far as to call me on my personal cell phone to ensure that I was taken care of. 

Everything went down hill when that prescriber left the service. 

I have been bounced around to a new prescriber each month. This means that each month I must go over my entire medication history, relay trauma to a new person, and wait to get an appointment. Appointments with prescribers must be made two months in advance and most have very limited availability (like 10 PM EST). To be quite honest, that wouldn’t bother me too much as I was getting consistent care. 

But I’m not. 

Every month since May 2021 I have had to go a week without medication because my prescriber does not renew my prescription. Every month we go through the same routine (regardless of who my current prescriber is): I notice I have 7 pills left and message my care coordinator for a refill, three days later my care coordinator says they will contact my prescriber and let them know, after not hearing something for several days I contact again when I have one or two pills left, my care coordinator says they will contact my prescriber again and they will respond within 48 hours, I call customer service because I need medication, I go through sudden withdrawal for a day while I wait, I get my medication. 

If that wasn’t enough, I have been switched to a new medication regime with ABSOLUTELY NO NOTICE from my prescriber. I was given no instructions or warning that I would be forced to go through withdrawal from my medications I had previously been on. As of right now, I have been trying to contact my “care team” for over 48 hours for hep with no response. 

The worse part of this experience is I truly, genuinely need help. I have been left in a state where I cannot stand for more than 20 minutes at a time (no shower, no driving, no cleaning, no cooking, no working). I have used every appropriate avenue available to me and have still be IGNORED by this service. 

If you’re in a situation where you are looking to use this service, please do not. I am begging you. My mental health is absolutely worse since using this service. The worst part is I am now dependent on this medication and cannot terminate usage of the service until I can get an appointment with a psychiatrist who gives a crap about me.",2021-12-20 20:07:36,1,"Please, for your sake, don’t.","{'id': 27379224, 'body': ""We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience.

False,Mallory Jean,"I was very excited to be able to try this service for care. I have used previous companies in the past and truly have had positive results on all aspects of my life. 

This company on the other hand does not care about customer service. 

The availability of appointments times takes weeks (2 to 3) to be able do your initial visit. 

If you have any type of busy work schedule do to Covid or anything life events don’t try to reschedule!! They will Mark you as missed your appointment and charge you anyway saying you “used their services”. The second appointment I was supposed to be sent a reschedule link and that came four days after my appointment. 

Rescheduling... that will add another 2 to 3 week wait to your visits. 

An entire month of service for not one visit. 

Then trying to reach out to customer care to explain the scenario. There seems to be zero training. My emails (because that was the “best” option to reach them) are returned days later. Finally I decided after a days of trying to cancel to try them by phone. 

I was met by a customer service rep who was dead set on telling me know. 

I explained my work situation and how I had lost my job previously to Covid and that I was so excited to use their service but it seemed impossible to see someone. She said it was my fault to cancel and didn’t care I was trying to simply reschedule. 

I asked for a supervisor to speak to instead because I felt very much unheard (which is crazy for a counseling service) which was met by multiple excuses. Finally she agreed and said someone would call me back. 

Instead I receive an email from the same woman not listening to me saying the decision was FINAL! No refund even if you didn’t use the services.

Please use a different service for you mental health needs.

False,usfentrepreneur,"The premise and promise of the app and service is great. 

The only bright spot for me was meeting with my prescriber — she was fantastic. However, there were several times that my appointment was cancelled shortly before our scheduled time. Once I was able to get an appointment, my prescriber asked me if everything was okay and wondered why I had cancelled our last meeting. I told her that I didn’t and it she was as confused as I was. 

I paid for 3 months and saw a care counselor once. Nice enough person but none of the information was new to me and I didn’t get much value out of the interaction. Mostly first-level advice and recommendations that you could get from a few books or blog posts. 

The customer support response time was slow and often many of my answers didn’t get resolved until the 2nd or 3rd time. I really wanted this service to work but unfortunately it seemed to be a lot of good ideas but poor execution. I had 3-4 meetings cancelled with my care counselor day-of and no explanation — just an automated email notifying me of the cancelled appointment. Then, I’d go a try to reschedule and there wouldn’t be any available for 2+ months. Very frustrating and unreliable, especially when you’re dealing with mental health care. 

Perhaps they’ll review this and other people’s feedback and improve. I realize that there is a huge demand and need for online mental health services and align with the premise of Cerbral but am disappointed with the overall experience. I’ve worked in startups for most of my career and understand the challenges of scaling a company but would like to see an improvement in the CX before reconsidering the service.",2022-01-25 18:53:46,1,Love the promise — disappointing experience,"{'id': 27703788, 'body': ""We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience.

False,Hello.Hello,"Cerebral tends to be money-hungry. Ironic for a mental-health app. 

Pros:

- My therapist was great. :)
- You get a selection of therapists that you can choose from
- You can dispute it with your bank for a refund, so that was nice!

Cons:

- I paid on August 28th for my September therapy sessions. I e-mailed in on August 29th to cancel my membership. Per my e-mail, I stated, “I understand that this month has already been paid for as I would like to finish up my therapy sessions for this month.” The Employee responded with, “I would advise to request your cancellation by 9 am PT one business day before your next scheduled billing date to cancel your account as we have no way to have it set to cancel at a specific date.” 

I understand there’s no way to set a specific date to cancel, so I requested to cancel asap as it’s understandably uncomfortable to rely on customer support to actually cancel a day prior to the next billing date. Once I cancelled my subscription, it *also* cancelled my service for the month that *I had already paid for*. This doesn’t make sense and is not customer-service friendly or mental-health friendly — it comes off as a money-hungry company. Why would you cancel the service for the month that you had already paid ahead of time for?  When it comes to any other service that you pay ahead of time for, once you cancel and get the confirmation of cancellation, it is applicable to the next billing cycle as you maintain the service for the remainder of which you had already paid for. After asking one last time for a refund and kindly requesting for said Employee to provide some Customer Support, I was responded with:

“Please be advised that we operate on a subscription model, the monthly fee is not based on services being rendered (i.e., receiving new medication, meeting with a therapist or prescriber). I do know that this is not the response that you would like to receive, and I sincerely apologize that we cannot be more flexible here. I completely understand your disappointment and do hope that you are able to find care that is a great fit for you.”

The Employee was kind and respectful, but as a Customer Support employee myself who also works in a Subscription field, I do not think much customer support was provided, especially when I kindly asked  for a refund a couple of times. It was rather a robotic response with a lack of empathy; you *can* be more flexible, but you choose not to; you can escalate it, give a customer a one-time courtesy refund so that they will come back. This may very well not be the employee’s fault, but rather, upper management. Given this experience, I will choose to not come back.",2021-09-05 21:45:43,1,Cerebral tends to be money-hungry.

True,this is a review by Sean,"Used the app for two months. The app itself is a mess, lots of bugs, did not retain my insurance information, and the telemedicine function is also very janky. 

But I could forgive the above if the service was actually worthwhile. Basically, this is only worth anything at all if you have no insurance and just need access to medicine. The counseling function is worthless - 30 minutes a month and they forced me to changed counselors after one session with no notice or reason. Who wants to start working with a counselor and keep changing? 

I also had an issue where I had a bad experience with one of the prescriptions. I notified them and it went through what seems to be a bunch of different channels of decision makers until they finally got me a new prescription - but once that new prescription was filled, it pushed my other prescription’s refill date out two additional weeks. Now my monthly medication has a two week gap - not good for the obvious reasons.

When I relayed my issues to Cerebral, I got a canned “sorry you are unhappy with your medication delivery” and offered me 30% off for three weeks. What? I’m saying there’s a whole host of issues, one of which is this odd delay in one of prescriptions, and this support agent boils it down to “sorry we couldn’t get you your meds fast enough, here’s a discount.” 

This service is only worth it if you don’t have insurance and are in desperate need of *any* support for your mental health. It is not convenient, not personal, and does not make me feel like anything other than an active monthly user in this company’s pitch deck for their next round of funding. It is not a substitute for in person services if you have the good fortune of having solid health insurance.

False,Bub4797,"Honestly surprised to see that I am the only one giving a bad review considering how unpleasant my experience was has been. Where to start? First, my “provider” shows up to our first video conference wearing a beanie and a hoody, like did you just wake up? I get it’s COVID season and we are having to do Telehealth but how unprofessional... Then to make it better my provider prescribes me a prescription which she says will be sent off and processed that same day to ship. We are going on 5 days with no update. 

The “chat” you get with your counselor and care coordinator isn’t live so you’re lucky if one of them sees it and responds when you need them to. I reached out to them and got a minimal response saying “oh she’s working on it”. 

Last night I sent an email to their contact support explaining my situation and received a response saying that my situation was getting transferred to someone else that dealt with providers and prescriptions as it was a very serious matter and would be handled as soon as possible. I waited all day and heard nothing so I called their contact hotline for live support to see if I could get an update on what was going on. I was placed on hold with a statement saying your expected wait time is 4 minutes... 12 minutes later I was forwarded to an answering machine. Have I gotten a response? Negative ghost rider. Will I after this review? Probably not.

False,emilywestmanfigs,"I have been a customer of Cerebral since July 2021, and in my time as a customer I have not had a single month where there hasn't been some kind of issue regarding obtaining my prescriptions. 

Not to mention, upon signing up to receive Cerebral's therapy and medication management service, I was not informed prior to the expiration of the first month @ $35 introductory offer, which inflated to over $300 without notice. I should have listened to the warning bells going off in my head after this first incident, however I was not in a financial position to obtain mental health services from another provider at the time.

Cerebral's mission of ""breaking down the barriers for access to mental healthcare"" is laughable, as my experience with Cerebral has been one of facing constant barriers. 

Barrier #1 - I have not been able to obtain my prescribed medications due to FREQUENT issues regarding dosage amounts and name brand vs generic mix-ups. However, Cerebral continues to charge me for a bogus ""medication management"" service. Additionally, I relocated from WA to MA and was required to restart my care with a different provider, even though all of my information was already with Cerebral. I had this new appointment with a provider on Oct 1, but have still not been able to obtain 3 out of my 4 prescribed medications as of today, Oct 22.
Barrier #2 - I am unable to connect directly with my provider and am instead routed through a ""care team"" to discuss sensitive matters regarding my medication status and mental health.
Barrier #3 - I was PATRONIZED by a ""care team"" member attempting to justify the cost of Cerebral's services in response to an unauthorized charge of $300+. I subsequently requested that my concerns be brought to a supervisor, however I only received a partial refund.

For a company claiming to provide mental health support services, Cerebral falls drastically short. Providing access to medication for mental health requires the highest level of attention-to-detail and follow-through. Cerebral demonstrates neither. Inconsistencies in medication usage can lead to severe consequences, including suicide. 

I am obtaining counsel to support me in resolving these issues with Cerebral, and will also be posting this communication on Cerebral's Apple App Store as a review, as well as Trust Pilot, and the Better Business Bureau.",2021-10-22 21:29:23,1,**CEREBRAL IS A DANGER TO MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS***,

False,toriht123,"I joined cerebral back in October 2021 using a trial code to only pay $30 for the first month regardless of which package. I have filed a complaint with the FTC as they have broken a lease or regulation regarding subscription cancelation ease and have extremely bad business practices. I suggest others who have had A similar experience do the same, in hopes that cerebral will be required to change and prevent others from having to go through the stress.

My personal experience:
I got to meet with a nurse in the first week, however the half hour allotted ended up being less than 5 minutes. The nurse was 15 minutes late and didn’t make up for it with extra minutes after the appointment would’ve ended, and she left our appointment five minutes before it was scheduled to end. I was told I should get the premium package with therapy (after I expressed I wasn’t interested in that because I have a in person therapist) and I was also told that I need to speak to a different nurse practitioner.
A week goes by and finally the app allowed me to schedule with the different nurse practitioner. It would be near the end of my trial but that was OK. However, an emergency on my end came up and I had to cancel my appointment. Her next available appointment wasn’t for another three months! Cerebral would not let me schedule with a different nurse, only her. Even if I wanted to temporarily cancel my subscription until then, my appointments would all be canceled as well. So, my only option was to schedule that appointment and pay $85 minimum for three more months before I could even potentially get help. 
In the third of my fourth week, I was scheduled to meet with a doctor. Cerebral canceled my appointment about 24 hours before it was scheduled. Her next availability wasn’t until weeks after my trial would end, so I tried looking for other doctors with their service. Again, I can schedule with anyone other than that person.
I wrote a complaint and asked to unsubscribe via email to their customer support. It took them three days to respond at which point they said they can’t offer me a refund. That’s OK, I just wanted to stop my subscription. When they emailed me back, they said I had missed the deadline (according to the TOS; two business days by 9 AM via email before the new invoice is printed) I would need to pay the $85 for the upcoming month, even though I wouldn’t have access to my account because I had canceled. I responded back to them because my initial email which was sent before that deadline stated I wanted to cancel, and their initial response didn’t occur until a few hours after the deadline- which gave me zero opportunity to try to properly cancel (again). They responded back and said they cannot help me.
I had to put a lock on my bank account for over a month to avoid their attempts at charging me. I was getting emails demanding I pay it. Eventually, it stopped and I haven’t heard from them again.
However, making a subscription harder to cancel than it is to sign up for is against FTC’s laws and regulations. 

And, a heads up-if you do decide to switch your program with the trial offer (which clearly states it is for any of the programs), it will try to charge you the full price’s difference. Even though the receipt will say $0 due, when you hit submit to switch to a premium plan during your trial period, it will automatically try to charge your bank over $200 for a few days.

I haven’t been notified if my account was cancelled or not.

It’s been days since I was told I would be contacted about a refund. My multiple requests to have my money refunded has been responded by that is not the support teams responsibility and someone else will contact me. 
I contact my bank, and now find out the $325 I was charged without my permission may not return to my account before the dispute is found to be in my favor or not.  Timeframe on finding out is anywhere up to 90 days. Reason for the possible delay. The company is hard to reach. They won’t even give me the information I’m asking for, so guess I’ll be waiting the 90 days. Care was great but the customer service feels criminal, I’m charged after requesting cancellation, cannot get an answer from the company, and my bank is telling me if they don’t hear from them with a solution its 90 days….

False,Karb03,"A couple weeks ago I was trying to enter my insurance information into the website & app.  I have “Direct Care Administrators” insurance.  This is listed on the drop down of accepted insurances for medical & for prescription on both your website & your app.  So I assumed there was an error happening with the app.  I sent a email in to support.  I kept getting emails with “FAQ” and not anything to actually help me.  I decided that since my insurance was listed & I would benefit from therapy services as well to go ahead and sign up for the prescription, counselor, & therapy option.  I do this thinking my insurance was accepted by cerebral so it would not be a huge charge to me directly as my insurance was again listed as an accepted insurance on both the medical & prescription drop downs on the website & app.  When I went to do this once I selected to upgrade there was no option to go back, I was informed I would be charged “the difference” from what I had already paid to the upgrade.  There was zero mention anywhere saying refunds would only be given at 50%.  Since I couldn’t go back I had no option but to keep going forward despite the website not registering my insurance that was listed on the drop down.  Because it wouldn’t accept my insurance when I tried to enter it after selecting from the drop down of accepted insurance & then I saw a $240 charge to my checking account I immediately cancelled the “upgrade” & change it back to what I previously selected which was prescription & counseling.  I then called into Cerebral to figure out why my insurance was on the drop down & the app not website would take it when I entered my insurance information.  I was told by the person I spoke to when I called in that my insurance was not actually accepted by cerebral for medical but was accepted for prescription.  It was listed in both areas in the drop down on the app & website.  I asked if I could be refunded for the upgrade that was made on my account & immediately changed back to prescription & counseling.  I was informed I would be & she would notify the department who was responsible for refunds.  I was never told anything about a refund not being for the full $240.  This was an error on Cerebral’s part for having listed my insurance as being accepted by Cerebral on the website & app.  Had my insurance been accepted like the drop downs on the website & app showed it was I would have remained with the higher plan.  But because it wasn’t I can’t afford to pay for therapy services out of pocket.  So I cancelled it & figured I would need to find a provider who accepted my insurance.  I then noticed a few days later a $120 refund into my account.  I was charged $240, not $120 so because I was confused as to why I wasn’t refunded the full $240 for a service I was never provided, was only upgraded in my account for a total of less than 5 minutes, I called Cerebral again.  The person I spoke to when I called said there was a “policy of 50%” refund.  I asked where I would have been informed of this because had I known that this existed I would have called in to verify my insurance as opposed to upgrading with the knowledge of being informed by your website & app that my insurance was accepted.  I was told this was something that was “only on our end” as in that I the customer couldn’t see anywhere that this 50% refund policy even existed & only people on the Cerebral employee end could see.  It’s extremely poor customer service & extremely poor treatment for a service that is to be providing mental health services.  The person I spoke to despite me trying to explain this continued to read a scripted message over me trying to talk to her.  I asked to speak to a supervisor, she responded saying “you want to speak with a supervisor?”  I said “yes”.  She responded saying “there isn’t one available but I can have a supervisor give you a call back”.  I told her I would like for this to happen & the call ended.  It has been 5 days now & I haven’t received any call back from a supervisor.  Out of my own curiosity because I didn’t recall seeing on the app or website anything about a “50% refund” I went looking through all of the “FAQ” areas, all of the website & was unable to locate anything that said this.  I assumed maybe it showed up when I went to upgrade plans, so I went back to the upgrade area & figured I would click to upgrade & since I already was aware once you select to upgrade that you can’t go back on the app I decided I would just close out the app instead of selecting the only option on the app which was to go forward I would close the app out completely & not upgrade.  So I went to do this, & when I selected to upgrade to the prescription, counseling, & therapy services there was a pop up this time that did not happen before when I had done this & was charged $240.  The pop up informed me that Cerebral was not able to provide “therapy services in my state” (Utah).  So Cerebral showed my insurance as an accepted insurance in their drop down list despite it not being accepted by them, charged me for medical services that they legally cannot even provide in my state, and despite both of these problems being at the fault of Cerebral misinforming customers they refused to refund me for the full $240 I was charged. When upgrading it also does not tell you what the cost is for the higher plan, it only says you will be charged for the difference of the plan you selected originally and the upgraded plan.  I would highly recommend anyone considering using Cerebral to call them directly before signing up, selecting any services, etc.  From my experience what I was told on the app & website was not at all accurate.",2021-10-16 16:34:16,1,Please read if you are considering using Cerebral services,

False,Gillestupidy,Do not download this app do not give them your credit card number or your personal information and especially your insurance information. Because it’s seems to be impossible to cancel this service. They do only take $20.00 from your card after that you will get billed your portion that your insurance evidently didn’t cover  for services you didn’t agree to or know about . You will get text messages and reminders for appointments  they  make for you  even after you thought you canceled the service.If like me you need psychiatric prescription medication you will only find out after you’ve signed up that Cerebral doesn’t offer prescription medication as part of your therapy  claiming state laws making it illegal,2021-07-02 18:43:01,1,Impossible to cancel,"{'id': 23843619, 'body': ""Hi there, Thank you for sharing this helpful feedback.

False,Butterfly4ts,So I read the terms of condition get super excited over how convenient on the telephone will be. Sounds completely amazing right? Complete opposite. They have a list of conditions that they are not allowed to help. Which they conveniently do not tell you or list anywhere.You don’t qualify for counseling you don’t qualify for psychiatric help. However none of this is made it public knowledge before you sign it . You find out when you meet a psychiatrist and they say literally within the first five minutes there’s nothing we can do for you but you can talk to the counselor and they say exactly the same thing. Surprise surprise yet another person who can’t help you and you know what the counselor says let me talk to the company and see if I can still do it weeks go by and they try to charge your card a second time. All you Get out of this is 10 minutes of people telling you they can’t help you and you said $150. In this case convenience is not the best option.

True,poopstick mcgreedy,"I would give this 0 stars if I could. They let you think it’s 30.00, but that’s only for the first month. They surprise charge you $85.00 MINIMUM the next month.  They lack communication. Not only did I not get my rx in the 2 days like they advertise, but the “care councilor” scheduled an appt with me and never entered it. Found out when I inquired about it they said she left...I never got word about it from anyone.  On top of it all they sent me a new counselor who decided to inform me that it was basically my fault for not saying anything to let them know she left.... they don’t read your messages since you will have to repeatedly ask the same thing multiple times. Go with your insurance or a REAL clinical office, because this app is a joke and not worth the hassle, time and frustration you will receive as “care”.

False,Amanda Nicole 0723,"Hello

I signed up thinking this was a full package experience of counseling and medication, which are most effective when used together for treatment. Unfortunately therapy isn’t available yet in Maryland. I’ll probably switch to TalkSpace, but hopefully therapy will open up in Maryland for other potential customers.

If you’re in MD and only in need of psychiatric care then this service would work fantastic for you.

False,HiDaviDavid,"My experience with Cerebral has been lackluster at best. At first, after initially having a consultation with the psychiatric nurse practitioner and then scheduling and meeting with my care provider, I thought this was good. 

My experience after that has been less than stellar. It turns out there was an error with getting my medicine filled. Which caused a delay. I understand times are tough, etc. but I was told it was an error in their system, not necessarily the pharmacy’s fault. 

I finally got my medication and began taking it. I was supposed to take two medications. One I was to take one pill a day for two weeks and then take two a day until my refill came in. 

Here it is the end of December, and I’ve only received on round of medication. I asked why it wasn’t filled out because it’s important to take your medicine as prescribed and not miss a dose. I reached out to my care provider who said it appears there was, get this, another error in fulfilling my medication so I didn’t have any medicine whatsoever. 

They sent in a prescription to my local pharmacy that I had to pay additional money for, to hold me over for two weeks until my new medicine is sent to me. 

What bothered me was that one of the medicines that I was taking two of (went from 20mg to 40mg) was refilled for..20mg. And I was told to only take one day. The dosage and instructions are completely messed up. The communication is completely out of alignment. I broke this down to my care provider out of concern that the nurse practitioner wasn’t even following the medication instructions she gave me. I was simply followed up with a “We are sorry. This is our fault” with no further corrections provided. Literally so now I’m taking a smaller dosage then what I’m supposed to be taking because the practitioner didn’t send in the new dosage that I have been on. It’s not been consistent and the attention to details and errors are too lackluster to recommend this service right now. You shouldn’t guarantee a service when you can’t fulfill your duties to your patients. I’ve now paid over $200.00 and have only had one prescription filled (plus out of costs prescription for pharmacy) and two small 30 minute sessions with a care counselor that you barely even have time to really work through problems with for it to be even remotely worthwhile. In my experience, the care manager really only works as a liaison between you and the company but that’s about it. And due to my issues so far in regards to prescription fulfillment, I’d look into other services.",2020-12-21 17:59:56,2,Mediocre Service,"{'id': 21223124, 'body': ""Hello,\n\nI am sorry to hear that you had difficulty in utilizing our services.
