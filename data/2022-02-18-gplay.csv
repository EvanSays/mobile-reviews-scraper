I personally had a better experience using Cerbral than BetterHelp and glad I made the switch. I think the negative reviews about lack of controlled substance prescription are a bit extreme . My care coucelors not only gave me other options for such meds, but informed me they aren't able to do so yet because they are *controlled* and online prescribing such substances will take time to be approved. My care counselors have been such a help. Worth every dollar. Thank you!",5,9,1.1.0,2021-01-07 13:01:03,,

I have been with this service for about 5 months now. They have always gone above and beyond to help me. The customer service responds super quick, any time I had an issue.
